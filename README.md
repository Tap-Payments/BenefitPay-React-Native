Tap BenefitPay React-Native Wrapper

# Introduction[]()

Before diving into the development process, it's essential to establish the prerequisites and criteria necessary for a successful build. In this step, we'll outline the specific requirements, including the minimum SDK version and other important details you need to consider. Let's ensure your project is set up for success from the very beginning.

# Sample demo[]()



https://github.com/Tap-Payments/BenefitPay-React-Native/assets/121755223/5849ba95-3375-4b8e-8bb9-c34d6dab2008


# Step 1: Requirements[]()

-  React native 0.64
-  A minimum  [Android SDK/API level](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)  of 24+

- in order to accept online payments on your application, you will need to add at least the Internet permission in the manifest file.
 ```gradle
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> 
//get internet access to complete online payments
 ```
    

# Step 2: Get Your Public Keys[]()

While you can certainly use the sandbox keys available within our sample app which you can get by following the  [installation](https://developers.tap.company/docs/android-card-sdk#step-3-installation-using-gradle)  process, however, we highly recommend visiting our  [onboarding](https://register.tap.company/ae/en/sell)  page, there you'll have the opportunity to register your package name and acquire your essential Tap Key for activating Card integration.


# Step 3: Installation[]()

We got you covered, `benefit-pay-react-native` can be installed with all possible technologies.

## Node modules

```sh
npm install benefit-pay-react-native
```

```sh
yarn install benefit-pay-react-native
```

Then run in your terminal

```swift
cd ios
pod install
pod update
```



# Import the dependency
```Ts
import BenefitPayView from â€˜benefit-pay-react-nativeâ€™;
```

# Step 4: Integrating Benefit-pay-react-native[]()
This integration offers two distinct options: a simple integration designed for rapid development and streamlined merchant requirements, and an advanced integration that adds extra features for a more dynamic payment integration experience.

## Simple Integration[]()

Here, you'll discover a comprehensive table featuring the parameters applicable to the simple integration. Additionally, you'll explore the various methods for integrating the SDK, either using storyboard to create the layout and then implementing the controllers functionalities by code, or directly using code. Furthermore, you'll gain insights into card tokenization after the initial payment and learn how to receive the callback notifications.

### Parameters[]()
Each parameter is linked to the  [reference](https://developers.tap.company/docs/card-sdk-ios#reference)  section, which provides a more in depth explanation of it.


|Configuration|Description | Required | Type| Sample
|--|--|--| --|--|
| operator| This is the `Key` that you will get after registering you bundle id. | True  | `String`| `let operator  {publicKey: 'pk_test_YhUjg9PNT8oDlKJ1aE2fMRz7'}` |
| order| This is the `order id` that you created before or `amount` and `currency` to generate a new order.   It will be linked this token. | True  | `Order`| ` let order: = { amount: 1, currency: TapCurrencyCode.SAR, description: '', id: '', , reference : ''}` |


## Simple widget initialisation
```Ts
function MinRequirement() {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      }}
    >
      <BenefitPayView
        onSuccess={(data) => {
          console.log(
            'ðŸš€ ~ tokenValue:',
            data
          );
        }}
        onError={(data) => {
          console.log(
            'ðŸš€ ~ onError:',
            data
          );
        }}
        style={{ width: '100%' }}
        config={{
          merchant: {
            id: '',
          },
          order: {
            amount: 1,
            currency: TapCurrencyCode.SAR,
          },
          customer: {
            name: [
              {
                first: 'Tap',
                lang: Locale.en,
                middle: 'Company',
                last: 'Payments',
              },
            ],
            contact: {
              phone: {
                number: '88888888',
                countryCode: '+965',
              },
              email: 'tappayments@tap.company',
            },
          },
        }}
        onReady={() => {
          console.log(
            'ðŸš€ ~ file: HomeScreen.tsx:145 ~ HomeScreen ~ onReady:',
          );
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

# Generate the hash string[]()

1. Install crypto-js `npm install crypto-js`
2. Import 
```Ts
  import sha256 from 'crypto-js/sha256';
  import hmacSHA256 from 'crypto-js/hmac-sha256';
  import Base64 from 'crypto-js/enc-base64';
```
3. Copy this helper method code
```TS
/**
     This is a helper method showing how can you generate a hash string when performing live charges
     - Parameter publicKey:             The Tap public key for you as a merchant pk_.....
     - Parameter secretKey:             The Tap secret key for you as a merchant sk_.....
     - Parameter amount:                The amount you are passing to the SDK, ot the amount you used in the order if you created the order before.
     - Parameter currency:              The currency code you are passing to the SDK, ot the currency code you used in the order if you created the order before. PS: It is the capital case of the 3 iso country code ex: SAR, KWD.
     - Parameter post:                  The post url you are passing to the SDK, ot the post url you pass within the Charge API. If you are not using postUrl please pass it as empty string
     - Parameter transactionReference:  The reference.trasnsaction you are passing to the SDK(not all SDKs supports this,) or the reference.trasnsaction  you pass within the Charge API. If you are not using reference.trasnsaction please pass it as empty string
     */
      const generateTapHashString = (
        publicKey: string,
        secretKey: string,
        amount: number,
        currency: string,
        postUrl: string = '',
        transactionReference: string = ''
      ) => {
        // Let us generate our encryption key
        // For amounts, you will need to make sure they are formatted in a way to have the correct number of decimal points. For BHD we need them to have 3 decimal points
        const formattedAmount = amount.toFixed(3);
        // Let us format the string that we will hash
        const toBeHashed = `x_publickey${publicKey}x_amount${formattedAmount}x_currency${currency}x_transaction${transactionReference}x_post${postUrl}`;
        // let us generate the hash string now using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm
        const hashDigest = sha256(toBeHashed);
        const hmacDigest = Base64.stringify(hmacSHA256(hashDigest, secretKey));
        return hmacDigest;
      };
```
3. Call it as follows:
```ts
let hashString = generateTapHashString(publicKey: publicKey, secretKey: secretString, amount: amount, currency: currency, postUrl: postUrl)
```
4. Pass it within the operator model
```ts
let operatorModel = {publicKey: "pk_test_HJN863LmO15EtDgo9cqK7sjS", hashString: hashString}
```
